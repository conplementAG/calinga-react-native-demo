# Run demo locally

1. Start Android Studio (setup using https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup for Andorid/Windows)
2. Open AVD Manager (Icon-Bar on the right; Icon "Small Smartphone" with green android head)
3. Start virtual device (create a new virtual device if there is none yet)
4. Change into this directory and execute the following
```
$ npx react-native run-android
```
This should open an additional console window which runs react-native-cli start and it should install and open the app in your virtual device.
